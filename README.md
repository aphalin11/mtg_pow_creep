# "Power Creep Analysis"
## An analysis on Magic the Gathering! with concentration on quantifying 'power creep' in more recent sets. 

The goal of this analysis is the quantify power creep and otherwise summarize trends in WotC's publishing of magic cards in each new set. It is a commonly hashed fact that magic, and our favorite format, commander, has been scaling up in "power level".

"Power level" is a subjective term. In this analysis we attempt to look at "power level" increases by observing a few facets of comparative magic features: 
- For a repeated function... 
1. Has the average cmc associated with that function decrease? 
2. Has the function been combined with additional functions over time? 
3. Has the function been otherwise expanded to be more effective? 
- Along different cmc values, do we observe... 
1. Higher power/toughness? 
2. More functions/card abilities?
